Life can be a whirlwind, and sometimes it feels like we’re being pulled in every direction. With so many responsibilities and distractions competing for our attention, it’s no wonder that we might drop a ball or two along the way. But should this occasional lapse in perfection lead to feelings of guilt and self-recrimination? Absolutely not!

Enter Moderate Neglect - a revolutionary mentality that encourages us to lighten up on ourselves and accept that it’s okay to take a break every now and then. Life is too short to spend our days wallowing in self-flagellation for minor missteps. Instead, we should practice Moderate Neglect by allowing ourselves to disconnect from the demands of life and indulge in simple pleasures that help us recharge and refocus.

Moderate Neglect isn’t about abandoning our obligations altogether - far from it! It’s about striking a balance between productivity and self-care, recognizing that we can’t always be on top of our game without taking time to rest and reflect. So pour yourself a cold one, kick back, and gaze mindlessly at the clouds  or a wall (whatever helps you unwind).

In essence, Moderate Neglect is a call-to-action for all of us to give ourselves permission to prioritize our wellbeing without feeling guilty. By practicing Moderate Neglect, we’re not only allowing ourselves to be human but also setting an example for others to do the same. So let go of the guilt and embrace the freedom that comes with Moderate Neglect - you deserve it!
